# Count_Ribo_Reads
The codes of Ribo-seq analysis, including aggregation plot, in-frame rate. Aggregation plot will generate normalized ribosome densities along CDS (near the start and stop codons). frame_along_cds will generate normalized in-frame rate along CDS (near the start and stop codons). The test.fastq.gz provide a test dataset which can be analyzed by any standard analysis pipeline of Ribo-seq. The aligned file (bam file) is requried for aggregation plot. A gz compressed file which contains ribo-seq read count on individual positions of individual mRNAs is requeired for in-frame rate calculation.
